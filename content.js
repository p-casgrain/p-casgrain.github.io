'My current research interests span Mathematical Finance, Statistics and Computer Science. My dissertation was focused on problems in _mean-field games_, _stochastic control_ and _statistical machine learning_ stemming from algorithmic trading. My more recent work uses insights and mathematical tools from _stochastic control_ to solve problems related to _stochastic optimization_ and _multi-agent reinforcement learning_. \n\n My PhD thesis, _Algorithmic Trading with Latent Models and Mean-Field Games_, can be found [here](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/95757/3/Casgrain_Philippe_201906_PhD_thesis.pdf). My most recent work can be found on [my arXiv author page](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=Casgrain&searchtype=all) or below. I am always eager to find new people to work with, please contact me if you are interested in collaborating.'
